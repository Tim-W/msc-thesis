\setheader{Preface}

For my master thesis, I was interested in exploring an area with present-day social issues and in building real applications. Inspecting the effect of the explosive growth of the Internet and the rise of Big Tech corporations brought my interest. Ever since I started paying for a streaming service subscription, I wondered what would happen with this money. I also wanted to support my favorite artists directly but found that there was no easy way to do this, and that some party would always get an unfair share of my money. This sparked my interest for a topic that Dr. Johan Pouwelse discussed with me, that came to be my thesis topic.

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Johan Pouwelse for giving many inspiring ideas, and for giving me the freedom to explore and expand my own visions. I would like to thank all PhD and Master students of the Distributed Systems group for enthusiastic explanations of their techologies. In particular I would like to thank MSc Matt Skala, for the help when I started building the foundations of my application, and Sandip P., for helping me with setting up infrastructure.

Working through the Corona pandemic was not easy, and I would like to thank my friends and family who supported me through this journey.
