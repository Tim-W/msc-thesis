% For my master thesis, I was interested in exploring an area with present-day social issues and in building real applications. I am a big fan of music, and especially of artists in some more underground/unknown genres. Ever since I started paying for a streaming service subscription, I wondered what would happen with this money. I also wanted to support my favorite artists directly but found that there was no easy way to do this, and that some party would always get an unfair share of my money. This sparked my interest for a topic that J. Pouwelse discussed with me, that came to be my thesis topic.

% I want to thank my supervisor J. Pouwelse for giving many inspiring ideas, and for giving me the freedom to explore and expand my own visions. I want to thank all PhD and Master students of the distributed systems group for enthusiastic explanations of their techologies. I want to thank in particular Matt Skala, for being very helpful to me when I started building the foundations of my application.
